I've used p5.js to create my mandala ouput and decided to use flower symbol as a design. The meaning behind the flower represent the cycle of creation and the interconnectedness of life and all beings.  FLowers are believed to hold the most significant and sacred patterns of the universe and everything in between.

The references that I used for making the mandala output: https://p5js.org/reference/ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8DeS2i81IY https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se9rsp2VMWk&t=12s https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efnl8kPL6Kw&t=9s

The additional topic that I'd like to learn about graphics programming is 3D sculpting. Using softwares like Blender.
